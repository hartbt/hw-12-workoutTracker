# **Description**

This assignment serves as a workout tracker, that allows the user to either continue a workout or create a new workout. The user is first prompted with the last workout and criteria to go along with that. The user is also able to view a dashboard that will show the duration of the workout, the pounds lifted, as well as the exercise performed.
